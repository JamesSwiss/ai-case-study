# # Exscientia Case Study 

## Overview and Origin

* Company Name: Exscientia 

* Incorporated in 2012 

* Founded by Andrew Hopkins

* The idea came about when Andrew was a PhD student in the 1990's researching HIV drugs and thought of how much more efficient it owuld be of there was technology to automate the testing and discovery of new molecules that can be combined into pharmaceutical drugs 

* Esxcientia went public on October 1, 2021 on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbole EXAI, having rasied over 672.7 million. They have a current market cap of 770.88 million with an enterprise value of 328.35 million

## Business Activities

* Exscientia is working to reduce the time it takes to discover, design and develope new pharmacautical drugs. They also incorporate target identification and patient selection based on DNA samples to provide drug therapies to patients. 

* The companies's intended customer who they can license their drugs to with the production capacity and quaity control standards already in place. Their focus is oncology and immunology, targeting cancer, blood, and inflammatory disease. 

* The main advantage that Exscientia has is their infrastcure. They were the first to bring (3)drugs to clinical trials and have been refining the process for the past decade, including the building of automated labs. Key partnerships with large investors like The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are also an advantage given their connection to the medical industries all around the world. 

* Their primary technology is AI software intergrated into their automated labs, 

## Landscape

* Exscientia is in the medical/healthcare and are considered a biotech company 

* The field of AI biotechs has moved from mapping diseases from structured date to where it is today, creating new molecules and rapidly testing the results against patient samples

* There are a number of competitors in this field: 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* One of the core metrics used by companies in this field is getting their drugs to clinical trials. Exscientia was the first AI drug company to get three drugs to trial. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

## Recommendations

* I would advise this company to add blood and saliva tests that can be offered in doctors offices or sent away for similar to gelealogy companies like 23AndMe. 

* Assuming permission is granted, this would significantly increase the data set that can be used for training their models as well as opening a new revenue stream. This would also increase the canidate pool for patient selection of new designer drugs.  

* Predictive analytics would useful here, measuring known genetic markers of disease against a patient's medical history, machine learning to help predict patient responses to treatments, and AI for disease modeling based on current, high quality data 

* This technology is appropriate because the trend is moving away from treatment alone once a disease is found and into early or even pre-diagnosis and prevention.
